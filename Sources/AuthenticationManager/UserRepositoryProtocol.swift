     - Parameters:
        - email: The email address the user entered. Need to set the scope to `[ASAuthorization.email]` on request to receive a value in here.
        - name: The full name the user entered joined to a single string. Need to set the scope to `[ASAuthorization.fullName]` on request to receive a value in here.
        - completion: After updating your database, you need to the completion to proceed with the authentication flow
        - error: If any error occured during your database transactions, you can pass it in the completion to notify that the authentication procedure included errors
