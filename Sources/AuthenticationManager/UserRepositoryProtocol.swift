     - Attention: If a user signs in multiple times on the same device, we don't receive any values in here. So keep that in mind to prevent overwriting any already stored values in your database.
     
     - Parameters:
        - email: The email address the user entered. Need to set the scope to `[ASAuthorization.email]` on request to receive a value in here.
        - name: The full name the user entered joined to a single string. Need to set the scope to `[ASAuthorization.fullName]` on request to receive a value in here.
        - completion: After updating your database, you need to the completion to proceed with the authentication flow
        - error: If any error occured during your database transactions, you can pass it in the completion to notify that the authentication procedure included errors
